University of Pangasinan’s U-Plug – Your Digital Campus Experience
============================================================

ABOUT THE PROJECT
-----------------
U-Plug is a digital platform designed to enhance the campus experience at the University of Pangasinan. It streamlines communication, centralizes updates, and improves navigation across campus facilities—all while promoting digital literacy and social integration.

OBJECTIVES
----------
- Facilitate campus communication between faculty and students via a dedicated messaging system.
- Centralize campus updates with a dual-feed system that separates official announcements from student posts for clarity.
- Enhance campus navigation to help users locate buildings, offices, and facilities efficiently.
- Support academic and social engagement through digital tools that foster literacy and interaction.

SCOPE
-----
- Development of a messaging system tailored for faculty-student communication.
- Implementation of a dual-feed news system to distinguish official announcements from student-generated content.
- Role-based access control for students and faculty to ensure secure and relevant interactions.

STAKEHOLDERS

- Professors
- Faculty Members

INDUSTRY PAIN POINTS ADDRESSED
------------------------------
- Scalability limitations in existing platforms
- Data synchronization challenges
- Poor responsiveness in communication tools
- Confusion between official and student-generated posts

WHY THIS PROJECT IS NEEDED
---------------------------
U-Plug aims to reduce reliance on external social media platforms used for educational purposes. These platforms often lead to inefficiencies and plagiarism due to lack of structure and oversight. By providing a dedicated campus tool, U-Plug fosters a more secure, organized, and academically honest environment.
